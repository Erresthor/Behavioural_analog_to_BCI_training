      "-> first action had to be on the bottom side  and the second action had to be on the upper side more the the right upper corner. It seemed that i gained the most if i did 1st action bottom left corner and second action upper right corner\n",

I could have tried how different would it be when I would place them not diagonally but one in the bottom and the second one in the upper position.\n",

Then I placed the first point from where the gauge starts & the second point at where I would like the gauge level to be raised to.\n",

I tried out different directions, but ended up on this one being the best.

In retrospect, I should have attempted doing the opposite by putting the first point in the top right side and the second point in the middle. I should have also tested doing the same diagonal line on different parts of the square such as bottom left to middle, middle left to middle up, etc.\n",

I chose to use the diagonal (bottom left, top right) because it maximized both horizontal distance and height and continued to do so because it was working. I thought about trying other stuff to see if there was a better/faster solution but since there were limited actions and a percentage score which I got 100% one time using the diagonal strategy, I just continued to use this strategy.\n",
      "-> There was a specific pattern that i had to follow, plotting the points first in the lower region in order for the gauge to increase \n",

      "-> I never found out how to control the gauge level. What worked best was timing the second click on the grey area to approx where the red bar went to. In retrospect, I should have pai more attention to the fluctuations on the gauge I think.\n",

      "-> I was trying diffrent lengths of the lines that i was creating, and after the fifth trial, i was trying diffrent angles. In the last trial, i tried to put first mark at the start of the last mark and it gave me best gauge level, so maybe this was correct way\n",
      "-> This is difficult to say because different actions prompted the gauge to move up at different times. When I repeated the action for the following trial it did not yield the same results. So, I'm not sure what I could have done differently.\n",
      "-> Avaliate what each point does to the gauge instead of both combined helped to control the gauge in the levels with the most success\n",
      "-> I noticed that placing arrows higher every time would increase gauge level. Then I tried to check if it would increase more if I placed the arrows in any specific area.In first try I decided to check left side and it worked perfectly so I just keep doing it to the end.\n",

      "-> i honestly think i didn´t really control the gauge level. even ehen i tried everything i just could´t understand how the game worked.  it seemed to me that it was simple intuition.\n",
      "-> I tried putting one dot at the bottom left, and the other at the top rigth. It worked the first time so I kept doing it that way. I tried to vary, by putting the dots in the reverse order, and see what happened. But it always did the same thing as the first try, so I kept doing it.\n",

      "-> Placing my choices upwards was the best tactic it seems.\n",

      "-> I pointed my cursor on the grey pad to figure out which sides increase the level of the gauge. My scores were terrible in the beginning. So I tried a different strategy by putting the errors apart from each other as far as possible and doing so quickly. This increased my scores.\n",

I did that to figure out the most efficient strategy as quickly as possible, but I found out that one strategy always worked, putting a dot near the center (but slightly down/left) and another one very closely diagonally (up right). With some minimal variations, it helped me stay near the top of the gauge in all 11 trials. I don't think there is any other strategy I should've tried or one that would have helped me more.\n",

      "-> I honestly did not have a strategy\n",
      "-> I tried to place the red right below the first one. At first I was kind of placing the markers all over the place, going side by side, one at the top and then one at the bottom until I realized that the gauge wasn't moving up instead it kept going down. So I started placing one red marker first and then another just an inch below, ascending down the page and that increased the gauge.\n",
      "-> my strategy was keeping them as close as possible and if i do keep them apart they should still be in the same line\n",
      "-> It was hard to develop any strategy with so few tries that I was given in each and every trial, but usually when I found out that specific positioning of the arrows made the gauge level go up I tried to stick with it to not mess things up\n",
      "-> The level kept on decreasing and increasing. I observed and acted fast. I shouldn't have panicked. \n",
      "-> I tried to find to find a single spot that I know increases the gauge level. Then I would combine that single spot with other spots on the sheet to try to find another good spot to use.

      "-> I think I should have tried to come up with more possible results that my two point input might have created. My mistake was to retest a few previously unproven methods to see if they produce a different result. I was also expecting to just get some kind of a momentary insight at some point, and I'm not sure if that panned out. From the hindsight, I think that the best strategy would be to diverse the actions in an attempt to crack the code to the system, then maybe try to replicate it, if that wouldn't work, then I would continue to try out as many different approaches as possible. And I would definitely take into account that my previous actions might determine my next actions.\n",

I did this until the gauge level (hopefully maxed out). Another strategy I should have attempted is maybe try to place the points in different directions and at different heights for the first 4 actions to figure out what would make the gauge level go up, and then spend the next 6 actions increasing it as much as I could (because sometimes, using my strategy, I was still a bit clueless about the relation after the trial was already finished).\n",

Then it was simply a matter of playing along the central horizon to minimize the amount of points lost and gained to keep it at a high level. If the grey area changed as I had thought it would... then I would be more likely to experiment.
